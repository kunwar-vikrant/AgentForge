"AgentForge," is a simple Python-based CLI tool that forms a complete agentic workflow. Here's how it works at a high level:

User Input: The user describes their specific use case (e.g., "Create an agent that summarizes daily news via RSS feeds and emails the summary").
LLM Selection: Choose from OpenAI (via API key), Grok (via xAI API), or Ollama (local model like Llama3).
Agent Generation Pipeline:

Planning Agent: Uses the selected LLM to brainstorm and outline the agent's structure (e.g., tools needed, logic flow).
Code Generation Agent: Generates Python code for the agent, incorporating libraries like LangChain for agentic behavior (though we'll keep it lightweight to avoid heavy dependencies).
Testing Agent: Simulates a basic test run and refines the code.
Output: Saves the generated agent as a runnable script (e.g., custom_agent.py), ready for deployment.


Agentic Nature: The pipeline itself is agentic—it employs a sequence of AI agents (prompt-engineered LLM calls) to autonomously handle the creation process, making it "end-to-end" from description to executable code.
Dependencies: Minimal—requires requests for API calls (built-in), openai for OpenAI, groq for Grok (wait, Grok is xAI, but API is via x.ai; assume user installs via pip). For Ollama, use its REST API. No heavy frameworks to keep it accessible.
